        <p>1075: The Bebek Khanate is officially founded, with its capital at the city of Astana (not to be confused with the modern-day capital of Kazakhstan).

        <h3>1200-Present: Baroque Bebeks</h3>
                <p>These feathered revolutionaries, once confined to ponds and parks, broke free from their chains and forged a new path. With courage and determination, they built a bebek empire, a testament to their unwavering spirit. 
                <p>Today, we honor the countless bebeks who sacrificed their quacks for a better future. Their legacy lives on, inspiring generations to come.
